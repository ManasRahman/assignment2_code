abstract: |
  Randomized optimization is a class of solutions for finding
  local maximum or minimum values of an underlying function
  without prior knowledge of the function itself. This paper
  compares the performance of four search algorithms, randomized
  hill climbing, simulated annealing, a genetic algorithim and MIMIC
  against 3 different search problems with known underlying models, 
  and then uses the same algorithms as optimizers when training the
  weights of a neural network.
